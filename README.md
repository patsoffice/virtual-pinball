# Virtual Pinball
The only thing available here thus far is a [SketchUp file](https://github.com/patsoffice/virtual-pinball/blob/master/models/Virtual%20Pinball%20Cabinet.skp) for a wide-body Williams cabinet.
A few different monitors are modeled to see how they fit in the cab with its current dimensions.
